Based on the data we cleaned, engineered, and analyzed, here are the **key conclusions** we can draw about Airbnb listings - both from the modeling process and the dataset itself:

---

## **1. Price is Predictable (to an Extent)**

We were able to train machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression and Decision Tree) that predict listing prices with **reasonable accuracy** - around:

* **MAE ~ \$287**
* **RMSE ~ \$332**

? This indicates that while the model doesn't predict prices perfectly, it captures **meaningful patterns** in the data and can estimate price ranges effectively.

## **2. Certain Features Strongly Influence Price**

From our EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and model training, we identified features most correlated with price:

| Feature              | Insight                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `number_of_reviews`  | Listings with more reviews often charge more - possibly due to trust or popularity. |
| `review_rate_number` | Indicates high guest satisfaction; higher values often align with higher prices.    |
| `availability_365`   | Greater availability might correlate with higher occupancy or pricing strategy.     |
| `minimum_nights`     | Shorter stays can command higher nightly rates (due to turnover cost).              |

Other features had weaker or unclear influence - and were removed or deprioritized.

## **3. Data Quality & Cleaning Were Crucial**

* **Price formatting issues** (e.g., `$1,000`) had to be cleaned before analysis.
* Many rows had missing or zero-filled values - especially in qualitative fields (like description, host name).
* Removing outliers (e.g., prices > \$5000 or = \$0) was necessary to reduce distortion in the model.

---

## **4. Simpler Models Performed Surprisingly Well**

* Despite trying both Linear Regression and Decision Tree, their performance was **very similar**.
* This suggests that the **relationships in the data were mostly linear or simple**, and not deeply non-linear (which would have benefited models like XGBoost or Neural Nets more).

---

## **5. Potential Limitations**

* The dataset lacks **location granularity** (e.g., neighborhood or geo-coordinates were discarded or null).
* **Room types**, host experience, or amenity details (qualitative) were removed - they could enhance predictions if processed properly.
* **Seasonality** (e.g., holidays, high/low seasons) wasn't captured - pricing often depends on booking date.

### Final Takeaway:

> We can predict Airbnb listing prices using structured, numeric features with moderate accuracy. While not perfect, models can provide **useful estimates** that reflect real-world pricing trends. More sophisticated models or enriched data could further improve this.
